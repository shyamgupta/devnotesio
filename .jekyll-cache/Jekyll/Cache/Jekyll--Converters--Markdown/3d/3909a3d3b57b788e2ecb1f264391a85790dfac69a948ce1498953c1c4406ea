I"Ô<h2 id="spring-controller">Spring Controller</h2>

<p>In any Spring web application, a Controller is a Java object whoâ€™s job is to handle requests to certain URIs. We will use annotations to methods in this class to indicate which URI each method should handle.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Letâ€™s first create a controller package within com.teamtreehouse.giflib</li>
  <li>Within the controller package, create the Java class for the controller and give is a name, say GifController.</li>
  <li>To indicate that this class is a Spring Controller, we are using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">@Controller</code> annotation on the class itself.</li>
  <li>In a Spring controller, we can add as many methods as we like.</li>
</ol>
