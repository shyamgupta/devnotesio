<p>Basic Auth is the simplest protocol available for performing web service authentication over HTTP protocol.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Basic Auth requires a username and password.</li>
  <li>The client calling the web service takes these two credentials, converts them to a single Base 64â€“encoded value and passes it along in the Authentication HTTP header.</li>
  <li>The server compares the credentials passed to those stored. If it matches, the server fulfills the request and provides access to the data.</li>
  <li>If the Authentication HTTP header is missing or the password doesnâ€™t match the user name, the server denies access and returns a 401 status code, which means the request is Unauthorized.</li>
</ul>
