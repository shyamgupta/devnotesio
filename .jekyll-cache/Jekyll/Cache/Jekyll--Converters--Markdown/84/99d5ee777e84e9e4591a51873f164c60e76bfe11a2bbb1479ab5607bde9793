I"Ô	<p>In this section we will learn about some useful annotations associated with the Spring framework.</p>

<h2 id="component">@Component</h2>
<p>During initial release of Spring, all beansÂ  used to be declared in an XML file. For a large project, this quickly becomes a massive task. In later versions of Spring, annotation-based dependency injection and Java-based configuration were provided which automatically scans and register classes as Spring bean that are annotated with @Component. Spring is able to auto scan, detect and instantiate your beans from pre-defined project package, no more tedious beans declaration in in XML file. Applying this annotation to class informs Spring that the class is a component and an object of this class can be instantiated and injected into another component.</p>

<p><strong><em>@Component is a generic stereotype for any Spring-managed component. @Repository, @Service, and @Controller are specializations of @Component</em></strong> for more specific use cases, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>@Service</strong>: Denotes that the class provides some services. A service is any class that provides methods to interact with domain logic or external components without maintaining state that changes the overall behavior of the service. For example, a service may act on behalf of an application to obtain documents from a database or obtain data from an external REST API.</li>
  <li><strong>@Repository</strong>: This annotation indicates that the class deals with CRUD operations</li>
  <li><strong>@Controller</strong>: Mostly used with web applications or REST web services to specify that the class is a front controller and responsible to handle user request and return appropriate response.</li>
</ul>

<p>Spring @Component annotation is used to denote a class as Component. It means that Spring framework will autodetect these classes for dependency injection when annotation-based configuration and classpath scanning is used.</p>

<p>Spring needs to know which packages to scan for annotated components in order to add them to the IoC container. In a Spring Boot project, we typically set the main application class with the @SpringBootApplication annotation. Under the hood, @SpringBootApplication is a composition of the @Configuration,Â  @ComponentScan, and @EnableAutoConfiguration annotations. With this default setting, Spring Boot will auto scan for components in the current package (containing the @SpringBoot main class) and its sub packages.</p>
