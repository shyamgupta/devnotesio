<p>The Java Persistence API (JPA) specification and itâ€™s implementations help developers in accessing, persisting and managing data between Java objects, classes and relational databases. Object Relational Mapping (ORM) connect Java and relational dbâ€™s.</p>

<p>Relational databases store data in rows and columns, but Object-Oriented languages like Java does not know about rows and columns. OO languages organize data in objects and classes and relational dbâ€™s know nothing about these Object Oriented concepts. ORM bridges this gap bewteen Object Oriented Languages and Relational Databases - it allows objects to be mapped to tables and tables can be mapped to objects.</p>

<p>The process of ORM is often delegated to external tools or frameworks. In Java EE this framework is called JPA, which is a specification for accessing, persisting and managing data between Java objects, classes and relational databases.</p>

<p>Using JPA, we can access a database without writing any SQL code. JPA is an abstraction over JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).</p>

<h2 id="hibernate">Hibernate</h2>

<p>JPA lives in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">javax.persistence</code> package, with different sub-packages, but most of the core API and annotations live in javax.persistence. Since JPA is a specification (set of empty methods and collection of interfaces) or a set of guidelines, it cannot do anything on its own. In order to be fullly functional, JPA needs an implementation, also known as an instance provider. Some of the JPA implementations are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>EclipseLink (Oracle)</li>
  <li>Hibernate (JBOSS and RedHat)</li>
  <li>OpenJPA (IBM)</li>
  <li>Data Nucleus (JPOX)</li>
</ol>
