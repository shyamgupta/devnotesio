<p>The Microservices Architecture (MSA) decomposes systems into discrete, individual, standalone components that can communicate amongst themselves, working together or with external systems.</p>

<p>What sets a microservices architecture apart from more traditional, monolithic approaches is how it breaks an app down into its core functions. Each function is called a service, self-contained and can be built and deployed independently, meaning individual services can function (and fail) without negatively affecting the others.</p>
